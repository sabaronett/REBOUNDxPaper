# Figure 6

## Prerequisites
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [REBOUND](https://rebound.readthedocs.io/)
- [REBOUNDx](https://reboundx.readthedocs.io/)
- [psutil](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/) (optional, for tracking active memory usage)

## Sample Scripts
Contained here are two main Python scripts that correspond to the solid coloured ([`gas_giants.py`](https://github.com/sabaronett/REBOUNDxPaper/blob/master/fig6/gas_giants.py)) and dotted black ([`gas_giants_tides.py`](https://github.com/sabaronett/REBOUNDxPaper/blob/master/fig6/gas_giants_tides.py)) curves in Fig. 6 of [Baronett et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12277).
Also included are required stellar evolution data from `MESA` ([`/input/eta_0.5/`](https://github.com/sabaronett/REBOUNDxPaper/tree/master/fig6/input/eta_0.5)) needed to run the scripts as well as sample output results from runs on a compute cluster.
